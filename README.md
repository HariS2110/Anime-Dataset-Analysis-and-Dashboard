This repository features the SQL code, tableau file, and dataset used for my anime data analysis project. In this project I explored the total number of anime in the data, the different types of anime, anime genres by count, overall user rating distribution, most popular anime, highest rated anime, favourite genre for veteran viewers (at least 50 watched) and the favourite genre for newbie viewers.
